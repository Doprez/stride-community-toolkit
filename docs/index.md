## 👋 Introduction

The [Stride Community Toolkit](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit) is a set of C# helpers and [extensions](manual/animation-extensions/index.md) designed to enhance your experience with the [Stride Game Engine](https://www.stride3d.net/). It simplifies and streamlines routine development tasks 🛠️, making it easier to build applications for Stride using .NET 8 🎉.

> [!TIP]
> Experienced developers might prefer exploring the toolkit's source code directly. These extensions are convenience wrappers, offering a foundation for advanced users to build custom solutions.

## 📦 Libraries  

The toolkit includes the following libraries, each designed to extend and enhance your Stride development experience:

[!INCLUDE [global-note](includes/libraries.md)]

## 🔧 Installation

The toolkit, available as a 📦 [NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/StrideCommunity), can be integrated into new or existing Stride Game C# projects. For more information on how to get started, please refer to the [Getting Started](manual/getting-started.md) page.

## 🚀 Fast-Paced Development

This toolkit serves as our preferred solution for rapid 🏃 prototyping and accelerated game development. Unlike the more stable Stride Game Engine, the Stride Community Toolkit aims for faster development momentum. As such, you should expect that **breaking changes** are likely to occur. This approach allows us to quickly iterate and integrate new features and improvements. We believe this pace serves the needs of developers who are looking for cutting-edge tools and are comfortable with a more dynamic environment.

## 🛠️ Toolkit Repository

The Stride Community Toolkit is an open-source, MIT-licensed project hosted on GitHub and supported by the community. Access the source code or contribute 🤝 to the toolkit on its [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit).

## 🎮 Stride Game Engine Repository
