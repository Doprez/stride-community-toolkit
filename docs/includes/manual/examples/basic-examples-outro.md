## Interactive Console Application

For those who prefer a more interactive approach, we provide a console application that allows you to run these examples directly. This console app, available in the [`Stride.CommunityToolkit.Examples`](https://github.com/stride3d/stride-community-toolkit/tree/main/src/Stride.CommunityToolkit.Examples) project, offers an interactive menu for selecting and running the examples.

Here's a glimpse of the interactive menu provided by the console application:
