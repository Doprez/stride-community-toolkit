> [!TIP]
> Notice the effect of back-face culling when moving the camera around the objects. With the default culling mode enabled, back faces are not rendered, optimizing performance by avoiding the drawing of surfaces that are not visible to the camera.

> For open or partially open 3D models, viewing from inside or even from outside through an open area may cause the model to appear incomplete. This is normal behavior since back-face culling intentionally omits surfaces facing away from the camera.
