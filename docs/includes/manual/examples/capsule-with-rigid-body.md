This code example demonstrates how to initialize a game, set up a basic 3D scene, add a skybox, create a 3D capsule entity, set its position, and add it to the scene using the extensions provided by the toolkit. The `Create3DPrimitive()` method, a part of the toolkit, automatically equips the capsule entity with a rigid body and a collider. This example serves as a simple starting point for building a game with Stride, leveraging the utilities provided by the toolkit to simplify common game development tasks.
